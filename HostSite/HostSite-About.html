      <h2 align="center"> Our Mission </h2>
      <p> Our mission is to help diffuse information to the general public about the fields of psychology and artificial intelligence, while integrating the two fields together. We hope to help people who need help and inform those who want to be informed. </p>
      <h2 align="center"> Limitations </h2>
      <p> `The following are a list of limitations to our mission:
        <ol>
          <li> Our founder (Jacob Knox) is current a high school Junior, meaning he is extremely busy most of the time </li>
          <li> Our team is small and doesn't consist of 'experts', per se </li>
          <li> We are not an official 'organization', 'company', etc </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h2 align="center"> Our History </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> July 2017: Psych AI is unofficially started via a social media page managed by Jacob Knox. </li>
        <li> May 18th, 2018: development of Psych AI's Psychological Diagnostic Artificial Intelligence (PDAI) website begins. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 align="center"> Our Team </h2>
      <p><u> Jacob Knox: Founder, President, and CEO </u><br> Jacob Knox, our Founder and CEO, is a high school junior who became interested in the field of psychology when he was diagnosed with clinical depression and became interested in artificial intelligence when he was first learning how to code in his freshman year. He now hopes to find a way to help people and further the field of psychology through the use of artificial intelligence. </p>
