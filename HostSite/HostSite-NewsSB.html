    <h3 align="center">Psych AI Begins Development of New Website </h3>
    <p><b><u> Alpha Version:</u></b> Development of Psych AI's new website, Alpha Version, began on May 18th of 2018. The site is expected to consist of a compilation of many psychology tests that can be taken while development of the Psychological Diagnostic Artificial Intelligence (PDAI) is under way. It is intended that users will have the option to store their test information in a "profile" for the PDAI to use in test trials. Links or buttons that aren't working will bring users to an error message instead of simply not working. </p>
    <p><b><u> Bravo Version:</u></b> Psych AI moves forward towards Bravo Version on July 31st of 2018. New to the site are all functioning links (except the About and Mission buttons), social media links, a contact page with Psych AI's contact information, and a handful of depression tests on the Tests page. Developement of a login and sign-up page/system is still under way along with adding more information about Psych AI. By the time Charlie Version is released, all links should be working and more tests should be available. Two forms were added to better connect with those who visit our site!</p>
    <!-- <p><b><u> Charlie Version:</u></b> Psych AI moves forward with Charlier Version on __. New to the site are improved user-friendliness for mobile devices (the side bar no longer covers essentially all of the page, although text is jumbled and things need to be worked out). We also now have a functioning 'About' page, making all current links functional, with information regarding our mission, our limitations, and our team! -->
